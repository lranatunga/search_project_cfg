Ingredients:
1 organic large egg 1.0
1 teaspoon whole milk or water 1.0
1 tablespoon cheddar cheese, shredded (you can use other types of cheese) 1.0
1 teaspoon butter or oil 1.0
Instructions:
 - Whisk the egg and milk in a bowl with a fork until thoroughly combined.
 - Melt butter in a 6 or 8-inch omelette pan over medium heat (approximately 30 seconds) making sure it coats the bottom of the pan.
 - As soon as the butter stops bubbling (and before it starts to brown) slowly pour in the egg mixture.
 - Pour in the egg mixture tilting the pan to spread it evenly.
 - Let the egg firm up a little, and after about ten-seconds shake the pan a bit and use a spatula to gently direct the mixture away from the sides and into the middle.
 - Allow the remaining liquid to then flow into the space left at the sides of the pan.
 - Continue to cook for another minute or so until the egg mixture holds together.
 - Do not let the underside of the eggs brown.
 - Sprinkle the top with the shredded cheese and with a spatula; gently fold the omelette in a half moon shape.
 - Continue to cook another 30 seconds or until the omelette is thoroughly cooked through.
 - Cool, cut into bite size pieces and serve.
